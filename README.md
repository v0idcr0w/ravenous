## ravenous project

First project with React, part of the course from codecademy. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Features:
1. Uses Yelp API to render a list of restaurants - with an image, restaurant name, number of stars, address, review count and category (pizzeria, steakhouse, seafood etc).
2. There are two search boxes where the user can type a location and term(s) that will be used to fetch restaurant data.
3. Additionally, you can filter the results according to three options: best match, review count, and rating.

**Notes:** 
- The design of this app is awful because I really wanted to focus on React functionality and not waste too much time styling the website.  
- For obvious reasons the API key is not included - get one at [Yelp Developer](https://docs.developer.yelp.com).
